Control many servos using Adafruit servo shield over serial.

Make sure to open the Serial Monitor before sending python commands or it won't work.

How it works:
The Python sends a control byte of 255 followed by n bytes, each of which represents a servo rotation between 0-180.
The Arduino collects all n bytes, then it updates all servos at once.
The next byte should be another control byte of 255.
The reason for the control byte is that if you stop sending data, then reestablish connection, you need a way of telling the Arduino to start over the frame, so you don't end up adding data in the middle of a frame.

If you change the number of servos coming from Python to the Arduino, you must change the BUFSIZE in the Arduino code.

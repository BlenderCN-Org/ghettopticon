Control many servos using Adafruit servo shield over serial.

Getting Hello World working:
1. Upload the Arduino code.
2. Open the Serial Monitor. If you don't establish a connection before sending Python commands or it won't work.
3. Open a terminal and change to the python directory, then run this command:
4. python 180.py
This should rotate up to 9 servos back and forth.

Reading from a file:
Follow steps 1-3.
Instead of 180.py, run:
python testshow.py
This should run the comma separate list of data in the testdata file.

How it works:
The Python sends a control byte of 255 followed by n bytes, each of which represents a servo rotation between 0-180.
The Arduino collects all n bytes, then it updates all servos at once.
The next byte should be another control byte of 255.
The reason for the control byte is that if you stop sending data, then reestablish connection, you need a way of telling the Arduino to start over the frame, so you don't end up adding data in the middle of a frame.

If you change the number of servos coming from Python to the Arduino, you must change the BUFSIZE in the Arduino code.
